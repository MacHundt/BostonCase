# BostenCase
This repository is an Eclipse RCP project. 

In my project I will primary analyze twitter data.
Data Fusion of Twitter and Flickr and aother sources into PostGis and a Lucene Full Search Index is done by preprocessing.
For the Map Visualization I am using OSM.

The name of the Project comes from the Boston Bombing Case, my first use case.
